Hi, my name is Ashley! I have a B.A. in English from Mercyhurst University with minors in communication and Religious Studies.
My interests include reading, writing, knitting, drinking coffee, listening to music, the environment, feminism, and spending time with family and friends.

As of now, my end career goal is within the entertainment industry, as I find life most enjoyable when I make people laugh or when I inspire them with a song. I would also be happy with a career in writing, editing, or publishing.

Thank you for visiting my blog!
