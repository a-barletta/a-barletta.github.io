## I Knit Mabel's Sweater from _Gravity Falls_

Hello readers! Today I wanted to share one of my hobbies: knitting! I decided to knit Mabel’s signature sweater from _Gravity Falls_, a pink turtleneck with a shooting star on it.

I have always wanted to wear one of Mabel’s sweaters because they are so cute and cozy, but I wanted to knit mine so it would also be as true to the show as possible.

And let me tell you, Mabel is some sort of magician for being able to knit as many sweaters as she does in so little time, because this took me about a month to finish, and that was with me working on it almost every day.

I didn’t use a pattern for this as I didn’t feel like putting in the effort of finding a free one that was true to the original design of the sweater in the show, so I sort of made it up as I went along. This caused a lot of taking apart and re-knitting, which was frustrating but absolutely worth it in the end. This turtleneck is so comfortable.

I used six skeins of [weight 5 yarn](https://www.michaels.com/product/premier-cotton-fair-bulky-solid-yarn-D657113S) and [size 8 circular needles](https://www.etsy.com/listing/991990808/interchangeable-circular-knitting?ga_order=most_relevant&ga_search_type=all&ga_view_type=gallery&ga_search_query=interchangeable+knitting+needles&ref=sr_gallery-1-20&content_source=f178d9d9d781dc4d3497acd8e9a01db6d5664194%253A991990808&organic_search_click=1) for this project.

Here’s what I did, but if you decide to do this yourself, please don’t depend on my pattern here because it depends on what size you need to make, how long your arms are, and how wide the neck needs to be, which is tough to gauge (again, why I had to take it apart so many times before I got it right).

Stretchy cast on 122 stitches

Rib stitch for 2 inches

Stockinette stitch begin

Increase 1 every ten stitches for one row (adding 12 sts totaling 134 sts) 

Continue stockinette stitch until work measures 12 total inches (2 inches rib stitch, 10 inches stockinette stitch)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Front of sweater:

Place back stitches (66 total) on placeholder for the time being. You will pick them up later.

Working with the front, alternate rows of kitting and purling until front measures 19 inches total (including rib stitch)

Place a stitch marker in the middle of the row so you are working with 33 stitches. Knit until you reach the last stitch. Turn.
Slip first stitch and purl to the end of the row.

Repeat steps 4c and 4d for 15 more rows (totaling 8 rows knit, 8 rows purl). Do the same for the 33 stitches on the other side. This is to shape the neck.

<br/>
<br/>
Back of sweater:

Place front stitches on a placeholder

Do the same stockinette stitch until back of sweater measures 19 inches (including rib stitch)

Do steps 4c and 4d to shape the neck of the back of the sweater
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neck of sweater:

Join the 15 stitches on either end of the neck with the kitchener stitch. Do the same for the other side of the sweater.

Knit one row in the round, picking up stitches along the way to form a circle.

Increase/decrease any stitches while knitting in stockinette to fit your neck. I ended up with 120 stitches and decreased every 3 stitches for 2 rows to get 68 stitches total

Begin rib stitch (k1 p1) for as many rows as you like. I am making mine a turtleneck, so I did this for about 5 inches.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Arms of sweater:

Pick up stitches around around arms holes. I ended up with 56.

Increase or decrease as many as you need to fit your arms. I kept the 56 stitches and started stockinette stitch immediately.

Stockinette stitch for 9 inches, then decrease 2 stitches on the next row and 1 stitch every other row for the next 32 rows (decrease to 40 sts).

Continue stockinette stitch until the sleeve is 18 inches long.

Next row: decrease 8 sts (32 sts total)

Next row: begin rib stitch and continue until sleeve measures 19 ½ inches long.

Stretchy cast off.

Repeat for other arm.

Shooting star:

I used a combo of [this pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJ1FwA8l9Ng) and [this pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN8h7oHEFJs&t=30s) to make the star, and for the rainbow, I simply knit 4 rows of each color, not including cast on and cast off, 25 stitches per row. I then stitched the rainbow on the sweater, making sure it was centered, and the star slightly overlapping it. 

The arms actually ended up being a little shorter than I would have liked, but I would have run out of yarn if I made them the length I actually wanted, and I didn’t want to buy another skein of yarn just to use a little bit of it.

I also didn’t take pictures during the process of making this, only of the final product here:

And now I have Mabel’s sweater. I plan to use this sweater as my Halloween costume, so I bought a [purple skirt from Halara](https://thehalara.com/products/everyday-2-in-1-tennis-skirt-lucid?pmui=10.1.collection.list.3.skirts&pmuih=skirts&_sasdk=dbm9kZS0xNzI4MDc3NDgxOTY3LXdhbWxra3U0MjU5LTJkY3N4cGx5Nzl4&variant=44017649647782) and plan to get a pair of mid-calf white socks. I have a pair of [black shoes from Eastland](https://eastlandshoe.com/collections/womens-loafers-slip-on-shoes/products/womens-sherri-buckle-slip-on) that are quite comfortable but not necessary to recreate this costume. Last but not least, I have a pink headband!

I hope you enjoyed reading about my new favorite sweater (which is saying something because I have a slight sweater addiction). Have a great day!
