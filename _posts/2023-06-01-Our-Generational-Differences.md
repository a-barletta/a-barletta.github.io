## Our Generational Differences

Lately, I have been noticing a lot of social media content on our generational differences. Gen Z, Millennials, and Baby Boomers are on a constant loop of maing fun of each other and pointing out each generation’s shortcomings. I guess Generation X is unproblematic enough to not be the target of these posts. I think that’s the generation most of the “Karens” are part of. 
	
One of the problems with the constant pointing out of our generational differences is that it further separates and segregates. In a world where stereotyping is more prevalent than ever, one would think we’d want to slow the spread fo stereotypes not only within race and gender, but also age.

Believe me, I generalize about other generations as a Gen Z-er. I grew up in a different world that the generations before me created, so I don’t think it’s fair for older generations to judge me for how I’m living my life. At the same time, my generation should be more understanding that people of older generations grew up in a different world than I did, and therefore have a different outlook on life.

I even see Instagram posts saying “kids these days (Alpha Generation) will never understand…” Not to mention I don’t think it was a good idea to call the new generation of kids the “Alpha Generation” since they’ll grow up thinking they’re the best, but I guess every generation does that anyway.

What is happening now is the perpetual stereotyping of people of each generation, which if not kept in check, can lead to pure hatred. The truth is that each generation of people do _their_ best, what they think is best for themselves and their loved ones within the world they live in.

What needs to happen is communication. Instead of older generations telling younger generations “Back in my day…” as a way of saying how hard things were for them, we all need to understand that things were hard for each generation in different ways. We need empathy over sympathy, for someone to say, “I understand things are hard for you, they were hard for me too and I understand what you’re going through” instead of placing blame.

This was a shorter post, but I hope it’s helpful. Honestly, I am tired of being made to feel like my efforts aren’t good enough because someone who isn’t even trying to understand what my generation is going through and how we feel thinks they should have a say in how we live.
