## FNAF Movie Clue: What We Missed

Hello everyone! I was watching the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie today, and I noticed a small detail that, according to my research, nobody is talking about.

In the scene at the beginning of the film when we see the drawings posted on the wall of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, there is a drawing of a kid named David holding tickets and a lady who I’m assuming is his mother holding a balloon.

When I saw this, a lightbulb went off in my head. This looks to be the only drawing in the movie where a child is named, which probably means something significant.

The child in this drawing is wearing a blue shirt and red shorts, making him appear similar to Balloon Boy. This, coupled with the red balloon the woman in the drawing is holding, seems to hint at a Balloon Boy connection.

However, the child’s name is David. A [theory by @Hyper Droid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ny2vrGMurWc&t=506s) on YouTube about the Survival Logbook say that the Crying Child’s real name is Dave. I’m inclined to believe this theory more than the ones that say his name is Evan or Cassidy–Dave makes the most sense to me.

So, what’s the deal with this drawing? Does it tell us anything about Balloon Boy or the Crying Child? Well, Balloon Boy is a toy animatronic, which means that the original intention of his character was to be part of the Crying Child’s nightmares. This was no longer the case by the release of the FNAF movie, since fans absolutely hate Dream Theory.

Since the toy animatronics are no longer intended to be the Crying Child’s nightmares, they are now real characters in the games who have scurity databases and are after the security guard. Balloon Boy is the only humanoid animatronic in FNAF 2, and he doesn’t directly attack the player. He disables the player’s flashlight, making them unable to see if another animatronic is on their way to the security office.

Crying Child, who possesses the Golden Freddy animatronic in FNAF 1, also doesn’t directly attack the player, he crashes the game, forcing the player to restart the night. However, this is where the connections between Balloon Boy and Crying Child end.

Another thing I want to keep in mind is that it was very recently confirmed that the first four games in the FNAF franchise are in-universe games made by developers who were hired by Fazbear Entertainment to cover up what really happened. 

This means that the games are canon, but pretty much any detail within the games can be retconned if necessary to fit the storyline Scott Cawthon is going for now that FNAF has numerous books, a movie, and another movie on the way.

Maybe the name David is hinting at something that will be revealed in a later FNAF film. I assume there are certain details in the first movie that fans will look for after they watch the second movie.

On that note, I’m excited for the next Five Night at Freddy’s movie to come out! I love the first movie, and I can’t wait to see what [Blumhouse](https://blumhouse.com/films/) has in store for us next.
