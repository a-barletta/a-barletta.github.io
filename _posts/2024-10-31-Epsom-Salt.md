Hey, folks. Recently I was on TikTok, and I need to stop that because the algorithm does not control me. Anyway, I came across a [video](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFtb2d5v/) talking about how the ingredients in acne patches are just epsom salts.

I watched the original video referenced, made by [Nina Pool](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFtqwM8M/) which did not actually make the claim that acne patches are made of epsom salt, but that epsom salt is useful in drawing pus out of pimples. The person in this video demonstrates and it seems to work for them.

I then found another video by [BrickShrimp](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFtbh2EC/) referencing NinaPool, claiming that sulfates are toxic and that we should not be putting them on our skin.

At this point, I was struck with curiosity, as I deal with acne on a daily basis. If this “epsom salt acne hack” is something that could potentially help me, I want to know the truth about it.

There are five questions I asked myself when researching epsom salts:

1. Are sulfates actually harmful?
2. If so, how much sulfate does it take to cause harm?
3. How is sulfate created? (If this is something I learned in high school chemistry, I don’t remember).
4. Which products contain sulfates?
5. Does epsom salt really work for acne?

What I found was that sulfates occur naturally in our drinking water and the air. From my understanding, rocks contain sulfur, which is released into the air and combines with oxygen to form sulfates. Plants can absorb sulfates and convert them into organic materials and they move up in the food chain. This is called the sulfur cycle.

Even so, water containing high concentrations of sulfate can cause diahhrea. While this is not conclusive evidence to suggest sulfates are harmful, I can understand that someone affected by high concentrations of sulfates in their drinking water would absolutely not want to drink that water.

Also, high concentrations of sulfates can destroy ecosystems through acidification of water and soil. Sulfates can also contribute to decreased lung function when breathed in. Luckily, there has been a 37% decrease in particulate matter (of which sulfates make up a good portion) in the air since the year 2000.

There is also no evidence to suggest epsom salts are helpful. Some claim epsom salt baths soothe aches and pains, and I was recently instructed to soak my feet in an epsom salt bath (with a few drops of tea tree oil) as a preventive measure for a toenail fungus.

Sulfates are also a popular ingredient in shampoo. I have been told to use sulfate-free shampoo in the past when I dyed my hair, and based on my experience, the color does come out faster when using a shampoo claiming to be “color-safe” even though it contains sulfates. 

Sulfate-free shampoo is pretty easy to find, I buy [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Love-Beauty-and-Planet-5-in-1-Shampoo-and-Conditioner-with-Vegan-Keratin-13-5-oz-Twin-Pack/1309740592?classType=REGULAR&from=/search) one. I’m not a fan of this product’s parent company being [Unilever](https://www.unilever.com/brands/) but that’s what they sell at Walmart. Sue me.

So, we’re already using sulfates in everyday products other than epsom salt, and epsom salt is magnesium sulfate. So, who’s to say acne patches don’t contain epsom salts?

I went online to the Ulta Beauty website as they list the ingredients in the products they sell. The most common brand of acne patches I found was [Mighty Patch](https://www.ulta.com/p/mighty-patch-duo-original-invisible-patches-pimprod2020519?sku=2572018) and the only ingredient listed was hydrocolloid, which promotes healing.

In fact, I couldn’t find any acne patches containing magnesium sulfate. This is unfortunate as I really wanted to think that I could use epsom salt (something I already have in my house) to get rid of my acne.

I was left with no choice but to try the “epsom salt acne hack” myself. I did what @NinaPool does in their video, and results were of course, inconclusive.

I managed to get some of the pus out with a q-tip after taking the cup of epsom salt water off my face, but my face did not dry out from the epsom salt. This may be because I mix glycerin in with my moisturizer during this time of year, which draws moisture into my skin.

I’d have to try again after I first wash my face in the morning to see if this method really works.

What does all of this mean?

People will try to sway your opinions one way or another, and it’s easy to get sucked into it all through social media. My research on sulfates wasn’t so much a deep dive, but rather a few internet searches from reliable sources. Still, not everyone does this and I think that it is a reasonable expectation to be able to buy products that are actually safe to use.

However, not all products you buy at the store are safe to use. Known carcinogens pollute all kinds of products, even our food. Ever heard of Red 40? It’s an artificial dye that has been linked to hyperactivity and even ADHD in children.

This post was not made to slam anyone for using or not using epsom salt. From my research, I do not find epsom salt to be harmful if you’re just using it in a bath every now and then, but always practice caution before putting anything on your face, since your face is more sensitive than the rest of your skin.

The bottom line is, do what works for you. I can’t stand when people tell others what to do in their daily routines based solely on what works for them, an individual. We’re all different. 

While it’s a good practice to research the products you use, you’ll find that almost anything can be harmful in one way or another. Don’t let that stress you out too much. Not to sound anti-environmentalist, but if we stopped doing things that harmed others in any way, we would literally never do anything. Remember that everything you do is going to have an impact on something–that’s what living is.

The truth is, we’ll all be gone someday. Nobody will remember what a healthy lifestyle you lived, but rather the impact you had on them. They will remember your kindness. 

Happy Halloween.
