## Lazy Potato Soup

Hello readers, today I want to share a recipe with you for lazy potato soup. It’s the new year and I’ve wanted to expand my blog to have baking and cooking, so as much as it gives me imposter syndrome, let’s make some soup!

I love making this for an easy one-pot dinner because it’s so versatile. You can add whatever you want! In the past, I’ve done sauteed onions with celery and carrots for a veggie potato soup, but I’ve also done bacon and cheese for a loaded potato soup!

Lazy Potato Soup

Prep time: 5 minutes | Cook time: 10 minutes | Total time: 15 minutes

Ingredients:

- [ ] 3-5 potatoes
- [ ] 1 cup milk
- [ ] 1 chicken bouillon cube
- [ ] Salt and pepper, to taste
- [ ] Add-ins and other seasonings, whatever you have on hand

Directions:

1. Wash your potatoes and microwave them 5-7 minutes, or until they’re soft enough to mash. I use a cloth bag to microwave my potatoes, but wrapping them in paper towels works too.
  > Note: you can peel your potatoes before microwaving, but I leave the skins on since the skins are loaded with vitamins and minerals.
2. Place potatoes in a large pot on medium heat and mash. You can add a little bit of water to the pot to help get the potatoes to their mashed state.
  > Note: if you’re adding any sautéed veggies to your soup, sauté them in the pot before adding your potatoes if you want to keep this as a one-pot recipe.
3. Add milk and chicken bouillon cube and stir. You can dissolve the bouillon cube in hot water before adding it to the pot if you’d like, but I typically just throw it in with the milk and let it dissolve as the mixture heats up.
4. Add salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you prefer. I usually add garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika as well.
5. Add any other mix-ins! This is the fun part. I usually add cheddar cheese for taste and consistency, but this can be as basic or as jazzed-up as you want. Just use whatever you have in your fridge.
6. Once everything is mixed in, your soup is ready to enjoy! This is great on its own, but you can eat it with garlic bread or even have it as a side dish with some sandwiches.

My favorite thing about creating these recipes is that you don’t have to know a lot about cooking to make easy meals that taste great. I’m no chef, but I’ve found that with a few seasonings, you can make anything delicious, even something as simple as potato soup.

I hope you enjoyed this recipe, and if you make this, comment below and tell me how it turned out. Have a great day!
