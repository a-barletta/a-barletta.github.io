## Goodbye MatPat

So, a few months ago, I said it may be time to see some new theorists besides MatPat at the FNAF scene. I DIDN’T MEAN I WANTED MATPAT TO LEAVE YOUTUBE!

This past year, we have been blessed with the “Year of FNAF,” complete with a few new games, the release of the movie, and the growing popularity of theory channels.

Since anyone who reads this blog knows I love MatPat, I had to write this.

I think he makes a really good point, which he has alluded to in previous videos, about his whole life revolving around content creation. In a perfect world, we would get to watch MatPat videos for all eternity, but content creation is probably one of the most mentally draining things. 

That is why I only write on this blog when I’m passionate about the topic and why I don’t post consistently. I break every rule of social media, but at least I’m not using all my energy on something I don’t see turning into a career (unless MatPat reads this and wants to hire me to the theorist team before he retires from the channels he pioneered in nine weeks).

But anyway, all types of content creation are difficult, and when it comes to social media, we know the deadline is always yesterday. I think being the face of four YouTube channels plus GTLive would be near impossible, but there goes MatPat again breaking every possible barrier on the platform he has spent so many years entertaining us on.

The first video I ever watched of MatPat’s was his very first FNAF theory. I was in seventh grade. Now I’m in my last year of college, doing everything I can to be prepared for whatever the world throws at me. This means I have been watching MatPat for almost half of my life, and he has encouraged me to use my brain to do things I find fun and rewarding, because the theorizing I do on this blog is never going to be graded–I just get to enjoy it.

So, thank you MatPat and Stephanie, and the rest of the theorist team for all you do. Discovering your channel in 2014 at a time when I should have been asleep has led me on a journey I may otherwise have never taken any interest in. Thank you so much.
