## FNAF 4 Minigame Talk

Hi everyone! I know it’s weird that I’m posting twice in the same week, but I have to get these theories out before the movie comes out!

Today, I will share something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately. It’s not so much a theory as it is something cool I found that may or may not be relevant/true, but still pretty awesome if you ask me.

I have a weird obsession with the [FNAF 4 minigames](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Category:FNaF4:_Minigames). Something draws me to them, I can’t explain why. It’s just really nice to see part of the story told plainly for once, I guess.

In the minigame where [Crying Child](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Crying_Child?so=search) is walking home from [Fredbear’s](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/Fredbear%27s_Family_Diner), he walks past five children. Sound familiar? Do you know where I’m going with this?

Maybe the five children are the kids [William](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/William_Afton?so=search) killed in the [Missing Children’s Incident](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/The_Missing_Children_Incident?so=search). He wanted revenge on them for making fun of his son before he died. Sure, not all the kids really made fun of Crying Child, but William probably didn’t care too much about that in his fit of rage against anyone who had ever wronged his son.

I briefly mentioned this in my [Midnight Motorist theory](https://a-barletta.github.io/2023/10/16/Midnight-Motorist,-an-Ongoing-Exploration.html), but I want to expand on it a little more.

[Here](https://freddy-fazbears-pizza.fandom.com/wiki/The_Missing_Children#Susie) is a description of all the missing children from the Missing Children’s Incident.

We know Susie was the first, and we know William lured her away using her dead dog as bait. I believe she is the child playing with the toy animatronic action figures in the playground area. Both characters have the same blonde hair, same pink shirt, and a bow in their hair. It’s hard to tell, but it looks like they both have the same blue eyes as well.

This, by process of elimination, makes Cassidy the girl with the red hair. I know this makes no sense because Cassidy is supposed to have black hair, but hear me out, that was back in FNAF 4 when Scott planned to end the game series. He didn’t have all the details worked out by that point, so I don’t believe this is a relevant detail. This leaves Gabriel, Fritz, and Jeremy. 

One of the kids is clearly older and appears to be one of Michael’s friends. He wears a green shirt and blue jean shorts, which is the same outfit as the kid who wears the Freddy mask when Crying Child is killed. He is probably Gabriel, since he is the one who possesses Freddy. This is shown in the image of the animatronic heads at the end of FNAF 4.

Here is the FNAF 4 end screen. It’s a little dark, but you can clearly see Freddy, Foxy, Chica, and Bonnie in a row. [Photo credit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/38/10/833810241be862d96dc6512632894026.jpg).

This is the Pizzeria Simulator end screen. The grave placement is the same as the animatronic head placement, indiciating which child possesses each animatronic. [Photo credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fivenightsatfreddys/comments/7rwg9x/lore_discussion_fnaf_6_gravestones_lorekeeper/).


The kid with the balloon has the same outfit as the kid in the Bonnie mask, but I don’t think they’re the same person since balloon kid is about the same height as Crying Child. I actually don’t have a clear anwer as to which one of the remaining children is Fritz and which one is Jeremy. There aren’t any clues that are strong enough evidence to suggest either way.

In fact, the balloon kid looks a lot more like Balloon Boy, suggesting that he could be one of the kids who goes missing a few years later during FNAF 2 and another one of Michael’s friends is killed instead. The ballon kid does laugh when he speaks to Crying Child, and Balloon Boy’s only voices lines are “Hello” and laughter. Maybe the kid in the Bonnie mask is Jeremy, and the kid with the Spring Bonnie finger trap is Fritz. It’s not quite clear and I don’t think I should pretend to be 100% confident in it.

All I know is that I’m pretty confident all of the kids in that 8-bit minigame in FNAF 4 are killed by William, either from anger or for experimenting once he discoveres remnant.

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed!
